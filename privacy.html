Trusted Zone - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: July 7, 2025

1. Introduction
Trusted Zone ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users and customers. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard data when you use our honeypot monitoring software and website ("Service").

2. Data We Collect

When you install or use Trusted Zone, the following types of data may be collected automatically:

IP addresses and connection metadata of visitors to your honeypot

Timestamps of incoming connections

Protocol headers and partial request data (for threat profiling)

Device or environment metadata (e.g., user-agent strings)

We do not collect personal information from you unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., by contacting us).

3. Data Usage
We use collected data for the following purposes:

Security analytics and threat detection

Product improvement and anomaly research

Optional alerting features (if enabled)

4. Data Retention and Storage
By default, all data is stored locally on your system. If you opt-in to any remote alerting or backup features, logs may be transmitted securely to our servers. In such cases:

Data is encrypted in transit and at rest

We retain data for a maximum of 30 days unless required by law

5. Legal Basis and Compliance
We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) where applicable. IP addresses may be considered personal data under these laws, and our users are responsible for lawful deployment in their jurisdictions.

6. Your Responsibilities as a Customer
If you deploy Trusted Zone on your network, you are the data controller for attacker-related logs. You must ensure your use complies with local regulations regarding data capture, network monitoring, and disclosure.

7. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or share data with third parties. We may disclose limited data only:

If required by court order or subpoena

To prevent imminent harm or comply with law enforcement requests

8. Your Rights
You may contact us to:

Request deletion of data (if hosted)

Request a copy of stored logs

Ask questions about data handling

9. Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. You are advised to check this page periodically for changes.
