  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 7, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Trusted Zone ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users and customers. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard data when you use our honeypot monitoring software and website ("Service").</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you install or use Trusted Zone, the following types of data may be collected automatically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP addresses and connection metadata of visitors to your honeypot</li>
    <li>Timestamps of incoming connections</li>
    <li>Protocol headers and partial request data (for threat profiling)</li>
    <li>Device or environment metadata (e.g., user-agent strings)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect personal information from you unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., by contacting us).</p>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>We use collected data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security analytics and threat detection</li>
    <li>Product improvement and anomaly research</li>
    <li>Optional alerting features (if enabled)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Storage</h2>
  <p>By default, all data is stored locally on your system. If you opt-in to any remote alerting or backup features, logs may be transmitted securely to our servers. In such cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
    <li>We retain data for a maximum of 30 days unless required by law</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Basis and GDPR Compliance</h2>
<p>Trusted Zone operates under the legal basis of <strong>legitimate interest</strong> as defined in Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our collection and processing of honeypot-related logs—including IP addresses, connection metadata, and behavioral signatures—are strictly for the purpose of improving security, detecting malicious activity, and supporting our users in threat analysis.</p>

<p><strong>We emphasize that:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The data is processed under legitimate interest</li>
  <li>The data is never stored beyond the minimum time required for immediate analysis</li>
  <li>In most cases, the data is processed in-memory or temporarily, and results (not raw logs) are returned to the user</li>
  <li>No profiling, behavioral tracking, or marketing is performed based on IP logs</li>
</ul>

<p>When Trusted Zone performs remote analysis or uses AI-assisted diagnostics, logs may be forwarded to subprocessors for automated threat classification. This only occurs when the user explicitly submits logs for that purpose, and subprocessors are either GDPR-compliant or receive only non-identifying metadata where possible.</p>

<p>Our privacy commitments include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opt-out support:</strong> Any user or contact recipient can request deletion or exclusion at any time</li>
  <li><strong>No resale or third-party sharing:</strong> Data is not shared beyond the analysis pipeline unless legally required</li>
</ul>

  <p>We do not send marketing emails to private individuals in the EU unless there is a clearly documented legal basis (e.g., prior consent, B2B exemption, or the email was made publicly available for professional contact).</p>

  <h2>6. Your Responsibilities as a Customer</h2>
  <p>If you deploy Trusted Zone on your network, <strong>you are the data controller</strong> for attacker-related logs. You must ensure your use complies with local regulations regarding data capture, network monitoring, and disclosure.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share data with third parties. We may disclose limited data only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If required by court order or subpoena</li>
    <li>To prevent imminent harm or comply with law enforcement requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may contact us to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request deletion of data (if hosted)</li>
    <li>Request a copy of stored logs</li>
    <li>Ask questions about data handling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. You are advised to check this page periodically for changes.</p>
