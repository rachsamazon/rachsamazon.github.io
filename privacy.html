  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 7, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Trusted Zone ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users and customers. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard data when you use our honeypot monitoring software and website ("Service").</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you install or use Trusted Zone, the following types of data may be collected automatically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP addresses and connection metadata of visitors to your honeypot</li>
    <li>Timestamps of incoming connections</li>
    <li>Protocol headers and partial request data (for threat profiling)</li>
    <li>Device or environment metadata (e.g., user-agent strings)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect personal information from you unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., by contacting us).</p>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>We use collected data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security analytics and threat detection</li>
    <li>Product improvement and anomaly research</li>
    <li>Optional alerting features (if enabled)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Storage</h2>
  <p>By default, all data is stored locally on your system. If you opt-in to any remote alerting or backup features, logs may be transmitted securely to our servers. In such cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
    <li>We retain data for a maximum of 30 days unless required by law</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Basis and Compliance</h2>
<p>We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other applicable data privacy laws. We operate under the following legal bases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> We may contact professional and publicly listed email addresses (e.g., CISO, IT, or security contacts) that are relevant to our cybersecurity offering. We ensure our outreach is limited, targeted, and relevant to the recipientâ€™s professional role.</li>
  <li><strong>Public data only:</strong> All contact emails used are collected from publicly accessible sources such as official websites, public directories, or corporate registries. We do not scrape or purchase private email databases, nor do we send marketing to individuals without a professional role.</li>
  <li><strong>Opt-out support:</strong> Any recipient can easily opt out by replying to our email or contacting us directly. We promptly honor all such requests and prevent further contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not send marketing emails to private individuals in the EU unless there is a clearly documented legal basis (e.g., prior consent, B2B exemption, or the email was made publicly available for professional contact).</p>

  <h2>6. Your Responsibilities as a Customer</h2>
  <p>If you deploy Trusted Zone on your network, <strong>you are the data controller</strong> for attacker-related logs. You must ensure your use complies with local regulations regarding data capture, network monitoring, and disclosure.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share data with third parties. We may disclose limited data only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If required by court order or subpoena</li>
    <li>To prevent imminent harm or comply with law enforcement requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may contact us to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request deletion of data (if hosted)</li>
    <li>Request a copy of stored logs</li>
    <li>Ask questions about data handling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. You are advised to check this page periodically for changes.</p>
