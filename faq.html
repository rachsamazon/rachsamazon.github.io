    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What exactly is a “sensor”?</h3>
      <p>A sensor is a decoy. A fake server, service, or port that looks real to an attacker. When someone touches it — you get alerted instantly. It’s like a motion detector for your network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do I need to install anything on my real infrastructure?</h3>
      <p>Nope. Trusted Zone runs completely separately. It’s isolated by design. You don’t need to touch your production systems at all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Where does it run?</h3>
      <p>Anywhere with internet access. A cloud VM, an old laptop, a NAS, a Raspberry Pi, even a jailbroken microwave (not recommended). If it boots and pings, it works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How do alerts work?</h3>
      <p>You get real-time email alerts when an attack or scan is detected — along with logs and optional monthly summary reports.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How many sensors do I need?</h3>
      <p>Start with one. Most small businesses only need one sensor to monitor their perimeter. Larger orgs may deploy multiple sensors at different segments or geolocations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I cancel?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Cancel any time before your renewal date. No hidden fees. No questions. No tricks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Why is this so cheap compared to others?</h3>
      <p>Because we don’t sell dashboards or buzzwords. Just security. Trusted Zone was built by someone who actually worked in InfoSec. We believe every org deserves real protection — not just the rich ones.</p>
