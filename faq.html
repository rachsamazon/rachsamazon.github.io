    Frequently Asked Questions
   </h1>
   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     What exactly is a “sensor”?
    </h3>
    <p>
     A sensor is a decoy. A fake server, service, or port that looks real to an attacker. When someone touches it — you get alerted instantly. It’s like a motion detector for your network.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     Do I need to install anything on my real infrastructure?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Nope. Trusted Zone runs completely separately. It’s isolated by design. You don’t need to touch your production systems at all.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     Where does it run?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Anywhere with internet access. A cloud VM, an old laptop, a NAS, a Raspberry Pi, even a jailbroken microwave (not recommended). If it boots and pings, it works.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     How do alerts work?
    </h3>
    <p>
     You get real-time email alerts when an attack or scan is detected — along with logs and optional monthly summary reports.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     How many sensors do I need?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Start with one. Most small businesses only need one sensor to monitor their perimeter. Larger orgs may deploy multiple sensors at different segments or geolocations.
    </p>

   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     Can I cancel?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Yes. Cancel any time before your renewal date. No hidden fees. No questions. No tricks.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="faq">
    <h3>
     Why is this so cheap compared to others?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Because we don’t sell dashboards or buzzwords. Just security. Trusted Zone was built by someone who actually works in InfoSec. We believe everyone deserves real protection — not just the rich.

      <h2>Compliance?</h2>
      <p>Trusted Zone is designed with regulatory-grade security and privacy in mind. All data collection falls under the <strong>legitimate interest clause (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> and is used strictly for intrusion detection and security diagnostics. We do not perform profiling, marketing, or store personal data long-term.</p>
      <p>IP addresses and related metadata are analyzed in-memory or short-term only. When external analysis is required (e.g. automated AI classification), only essential metadata is forwarded — with all subprocessors operating under GDPR-compliant contracts and controls.</p>
      <p>Trusted Zone supports full audit logging, opt-out mechanisms, and can operate entirely within the EU perimeter. Our system is deployable in high-security environments including financial institutions, critical infrastructure, and regulated SaaS platforms. We provide a full <strong>GDPR risk analysis and DPA upon request</strong>.</p>
